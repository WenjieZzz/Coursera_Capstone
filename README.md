# Coursera_Capstone The Battle of Neighborhood (Week 2)

This project utilizes postal code information from Wikipdeia and Foursquare API to deliver an illustration of what kind of venues are in a certain neighbourhood, may give some guidance for people when they are choosing a place to live at.

As the financial capital of Canada, Toronto has witnessed a rapidly growing population of immigrants. Finding a place to stay comes on the top of the list for most of them. And with regards to choosing a place to live, despite the price, convenience of the location becomes the first concern. Talking about the convenience of a place, different people may have various opinions depending on their age, marital status, background etc.

Young people may like to be surrounded by restaurants, cafes and bars. Family with little children will probably like a neighbourhood with accessible grocery stores and museums better. While the elders may find a place close to a hospital is convenient.

At the end of project, based on the chart of information we have got. We can confidently give out the following conclusion:

 1. Central Toronto people love Italian food, immigrants from Italy may feel more like home there.
 2. Etobicoke and North York has a lot of banks there, immigrants with financial background may find it easier to get a job there.
 3. Italian restaurant and pizza place are quite popular across all GTA, new immigrants may find it a good idea to open one of them. Pro: Totonro people love it! Con: Too many competitors.
 4. Mississauga has many hotels in its area, probably because it's near the airport.
 5.West Toronto people love night lifes, you can tell it from the number of bars.
